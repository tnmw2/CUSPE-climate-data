CCC Carbon footprint data gaps and areas which could be improved,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Area,Activity,Current Accuracy / Confidence level in data,Current Methodology / Data source,Reason for exclusion to date,Who holds this data now,What is needed to improve this data,Emissions Scope,Likely carbon impact (size of the problem),Sarah's notes July 2022
Buildings and utilities,Refrigerant gases leakage from air conditioning units in CCC-controlled buildings,Medium,"Estimated based on last year’s data, which was based on leakage assumed from top-ups at servicing, applied to CCC list of A/C units, type of refrigerant gas and capacity. ",N/A,CCC's maintenance contractor or the Property team,Use actual data from AC servicing reports. This data should already exist but I have had difficulty getting hold of it. ,1,Very low,we now have this data for 2021-22
Transport,Social and education transport in own fleet. ,Medium,Data from a combination of fuel card reports for some vehicles and estimated mileage for others. Fuel consumption data and type of fuel is used where known. Actual mileage records used if no fuel usage data available. Estimated mileage used if neither fuel usage nor actual mileage available. ,N/A,Multiple teams that manage fleet vehicles,Fuel usage data for all fleet vehicles.,1,Low to medium,I now believe that all vehicles are covered by fuel cards so we do probably have all this data but not 100% sure
Transport,"Travel by public transport incl flights, trains, buses and taxis, where known",Low,Currently only have partial data on this. Some train and bus travel estimated from spend. ,N/A,Multiple individuals who travel on business,Include distance travelled on expenses claims system and on credit card reports. ,3,Low,

Transport,Employee home to work commuting,Low,Estimated based on annual staff travel survey in October. A sample of employees provided detailed information on their modes of travel and distance travelled for one week. Assumed this was representative of all employees and based on a typical week. Extrapolated to all employees and assumed working 47 weeks per year. ,N/A,Individual employees,"More frequent travel surveys / higher response rate, or another way to collect commuting data",3,Low to medium,
Waste,Disposal / treatment of Cambridgeshire waste (as the statutory waste authority),Medium,"Based on waste volumes collected by all the City and District Councils in Cambridgeshire, and from all of the Household Waste Recycling Centres in Cambridgeshire, and proportions of waste recycled, composted and landfilled.  Landfill gas emissions modelled using similar method to that of 2019 CUSPE report (Weber, et al., 2019), applied to updated data set. Composting emissions estimated based on Cambridgeshire share of UK population and national emissions data. ",N/A,"Waste team hold waste volumes, other data from treatment facilities (contractors)",Carbon calculators for household waste already being developed through LGA Net Zero Innovation project. ,3,Very high,Waste carbon calculator now nearly finished so this one will be resolved this year. 
Agriculture ,County farms / rural estates ,Low,"Estimated based on area of land used for livestock, number of cattle, number of sheep, and area of land used for crops, with UK average GHG emissions rates for these uses (based on UK GHG inventory) applied. ",N/A,"Multiple sources incl Strategic assets team, Farm tenants, and some unknown / data might not exist. ","Updated data on area of land owned, land use, number of animals. Up to date info on agricultural methods used and carbon impact. Updated GHG emissions factors for agriculture. ",3,Medium to high,
"Land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF)","Area of land used as cropland, grassland, wetlands, forestland and settlements",Low,"Estimated based on area of land owned by CCC of each type, and emissions factors calculated from the UK GHG Inventory. ",N/A,"Multiple sources incl Strategic assets team, Farm tenants, and some unknown / data might not exist. ",Updated info on land area and use. + Further research to verify accuracy of GHG emissions factors used. ,3,Medium to high,
Purchased goods and services,Construction and buildings works – major capital projects,Medium,"Inventory of each material used and quantity (tonnes) data from project information and/or capital works contractors (where available). Materials used multiplied by the relevant conversion factors for each material. This data was available for the majority of the total spend on major capital works, with the remaining spend assumed to have a similar composition of materials and emissions estimated on a pro rata basis. ",N/A,Various contractors for building works. ,Data to be provided for all projects not just some. Contractors to (be obliged to) provide data without multiple chases. ,3,Very high,
Purchased goods and services,"Minor building works, repairs, refurbishments etc",None,None,No data provided. Unable to estimate. Expect this to be very low. ,May not exist. Various teams will know what work has been done but not detail to enable embodied carbon calculation,Method to estimate based on spend or type of work?,3,Medium,new row added
Purchased goods and services,Highways works,Medium,Data provided by our highways contractor (Milestone) for the works they did on our behalf. ,N/A,Highways contractor,Better understanding/ visibility of the data provided by Milestone. ,3,Medium,
Buildings and utilities,Diesel used for on-site generators,None,None,No data provided. Unable to estimate. Expect this to be very low. ,Property team,Data to be provided.,1,Very low,we now have this data for 2021-22
Buildings and utilities,"Energy used at sites outside of CCC control e.g. space in a shared building, third party premises, and CCC-owned sites let to commercial or private tenants. ",None,None,We do not have access to this data.,"Possibly strategic assets, more likely multiple tenants of buildings. ",Data to be provided.,3,Unknown - likely low to medium,
